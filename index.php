						<h2 class="plumtext" style="display: inline;">Willow Weiner</h2> is currently a fourth-year at Oberlin College. While origionally admitted for French Horn Performance, her roots have spread into the stranger corners of the institution. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to majoring in <em>Mathematics</em>, Willow is working through an individually-proposed conservatory major in <em>Artistic Engineering</em> (a working title). The major centers around application of scientific knowledge and structures to creative pursuits (especially in the sonic medium). Think of things like:

						<ul style="padding-left: 4rem; text-align: left;">
							<li>generative and algoritmic composition,</li>
							<li>machine-learning based timbre replication,</li>
							<li>the modeling of room acoustics (especially for VR), and</li>
							<li>real-time audio signal processing.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						While epecially interested in the above, Willow also enjoys watching thunderstorms and humming.
